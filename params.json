I have been an avid contributor to many open source projects such as Spring MVC, Tomcat. However, after using Java for over 5 years, I have been dealing with minor technical flaws. At first, I ignored and even tolerated these flaws, but ultimately, I was forced to confront reality. I could not live with these flaws, and since Java is a mature language, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to actually fix these flaws.\r\n\r\nI also resented the opinions that Java took. When I first used those languages, I thought those opinions were a fresh breath of air. I would constantly defend those opinions on Hacker News, because I thought that these opinions would promote good coding practices and would ulitmately lead to higher productivity. After 5 years of coding though, I realized that those opinions may have been slightly flawed.\r\n\r\nAnd then, I heard of Python. Python promised to fix all the technical flaws in Java. I also read about the opinions inherent in Python, and realized that those opinions were utterly correct, compared to the fallicious and wrong-headed opinions in Java. And that’s why I switched languages.\r\n\r\nLet me show you an example to prove my point.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a “Hello World” program in Java:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n\r\npublic class Java {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see why I was drawn to this language. Its syntatic sugar was beautiful. But it was ultimately too magical. I didn’t know what was actually going on. What did Format mean? Or Write? When I had to scale up my program, I would be cursing all night trying to debug the latest ‘magic’ that Java decided to invoke on me. Half the time, I would be fighting against Java’s constraining limits.\r\n\r\nAnd here’s an example of “Hello World” in Python:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\nprint \"Hello World\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see how easily readable and maintainable Python is over Java. Its syntax is just as elegant as Java, but there’s no magic involved. Everything that I need to know is right there, ready to be understood in an easy-to-digest fashion. There’s no fighting with the language here, just me working with my trusty new tool.\r\n\r\nAlways use the best tool for the job. That’s why I have chosen to use Python for all my obscure side-projects. It will likely not have any technical flaws whatsoever, nor will its opinions ever turn out to be wrong. And, in the rare case that Python disappoints me…well, there’s always Python3…\r\n\r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nDo you want a website for this projects?\r\n\r\nFeel free to give PR. :D\r\n",
